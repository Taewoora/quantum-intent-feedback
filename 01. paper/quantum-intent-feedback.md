## Abstract

This study proposes and demonstrates an experimental quantum feedback loop, where observer intention—encoded as priority vectors in gate parameters—guides the structural evolution of a quantum system. Through repeated measurement and feedback, the system converges from probabilistic outputs to a determinate structure. Shannon entropy drops near zero, and output distributions stabilize. This suggests that observation can serve not as collapse, but as structural refinement of meaning within quantum systems.

## 1. Introduction

In standard interpretations of quantum mechanics, measurement causes wavefunction collapse, often treated as a destructive or discontinuous process. In this paper, we propose an alternative role: observation as a means of structural refinement and intention amplification. We demonstrate experimentally that initial observation priorities can iteratively shape circuit outputs toward determinate, low-entropy states.

## 2. Theoretical Background

The observer's intention is encoded in a priority vector  
`U = [u₁, u₂, ..., uₙ]`,  
applied as rotation parameters `Ry(uᵢ · π)` on each qubit.

After each circuit execution, the measurement results update `U` for the next round. This creates a closed feedback loop:

**Intention → Measurement → Structural Update → Reinforced Intention**

## 3. Experiment

### 3.1 Circuit and Feedback Procedure

- 3-qubit quantum circuit
- Initial priority vector: `U₀ = [0.2, 0.7, 0.9]`
- Each iteration:
  1. Apply `Ry(uᵢ · π)` on each qubit.
  2. Measure the output over 1024 shots.
  3. Update `U` based on the bitwise frequency of 1s.
- Repeat the above for 10 feedback rounds.
- Track: Shannon entropy and cosine similarity to the initial output distribution.

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Convergence

- After only 3 rounds:  
  `U → [0.01, 0.99, 0.99]` (locked state)
- Output entropy collapsed to nearly zero.
- Cosine similarity with the initial output stabilized above **0.955**.

## 5. Discussion

This experiment demonstrates that observation, when tied to feedback, can act as a mechanism for structure generation rather than probabilistic collapse.

- The system evolves from randomness to determination.
- Intention shapes measurement, and measurement reinforces intention.
- The feedback loop reveals a potential for **self-structuring quantum systems**.

## 6. Conclusion

Quantum systems can be interpreted as feedback-driven structures where intention initiates, measurement refines, and iteration enforces structural coherence.

> Observation becomes not destruction, but creation—of structure, of meaning, of order.
